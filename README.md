### Work Experience

**Graduate Student Researcher**, *Beck Research Lab, University of Washington, Seattle, WA*

[Machine Learning for data-driven Drug Discovery](https://github.com/BeckResearchLab/small-molecule-design-toolkit) (Masterâ€™s Thesis)
-	Built Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) regression models using machine learning methods
-	Wrote Python scripts to calculate 820 molecular descriptors and automate the model training process
-	Reduced MAE by 10% compared to previous studies and reduced run-time by 20%

**Data Science Capstone Project Member**, *Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA*

[Network Analysis and Visualization of Energy Research domain](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/KnowledgeNetworks) (Industry Partnered Capstone Project)
-	Led a group of 3 graduate students to build a knowledge network and track collaborations in energy research
-	Wrote web-scraping scripts in Python for downloading 27,000 records from academic citation indexes
-	Developed a [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rahul1168#!/vizhome/NuclearEnergyResearch/NuclearEnergyResearch) of the network and tested various hypotheses

**Data Science Trainee**, *Clean Energy Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA*

[Time Series Forecast of Renewable Energy in the United States](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Clean-Energy-Outlook) (Coursework Project)
- Led a group of 4 graduate students to develop an auto-regression (AR) model to forecast clean energy demand
- Parsed, cleaned data from government databases; Reduced model error by 50% and improved unit test coverage by 70%
- Developed a [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rahul1168#!/vizhome/TableauWorkbookforSVRPrediction/CleanEnergyProductioninthecontiguousUnitedStates) to visualize the clean energy demand of the United States

[Regression Analysis of Harvard Clean Energy Project Database](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/harvard%20clean%20energy%20project%20database) (Coursework Project)
- Developed regression models and used hypothesis testing to analyze effects of voltage, current on power conversion efficiency
- Used resampling methods like bootstrapping to plot Mean Standard Error (MSE) vs number of bootstrap samples

[K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/k%20nearest%20neighbors%20classifier) (Coursework Project)
- Developed own implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier to predict atom type based on its radius
- Wrote unit tests to test the written functions; Tested atomradii data for different k values; Achieved accuracy of upto 80%

[Statistical Analysis of Energy and Water Consumption](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/energy%20and%20water%20consumption) (Coursework Project)
- Performed descriptive statistical analysis of the data; Calculated descriptive statistical calculations and plotted box plots
- Plotted normalized histograms and probability distribution functions; Performed hypothesis testing for various hypotheses

### Independent Projects

[House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/house%20prices) (Kaggle)
- Performed feature selection and trained a ridge regression model; Achieved coefficient of determination of ~0.81

[Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/titanic) (Kaggle)
- Cleaned the data; Performed exploratory data analysis and selected relevent features to train the machine learning model
- Trained a Random Forests Classifier model to predict survival and achieved an accuracy of 81% 

[Time Series Forecast of Vehicle Traffic at Signals](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/vehicle%20traffic) (McKinsey Analytics Online Hackathon)
- Developed a preliminary additive model for forecasting where non-linear hourly traffic trends are fit with yearly and weekly seasonality
- Ranked among top 10% among all participants

[E-Commerce Product Classifier based on Image and Text data](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/e-commerce%20product%20classifier)
- Built a prototype data pipeline in Python for classifying 60,000 e-commerce products into 63 categories
- Trained a bag of words model for text classification and convolutional neural network for image classification
- Achieved a text classification accuracy of 87% and image classification accuracy of 60%
