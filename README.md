# Portfolio
A curated list of all my data science projects

### Work Experience

**Data Science Capstone Project Member**, *Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA*

[Network Analysis and Visualization of Energy Research domain](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/KnowledgeNetworks) (Industry Partnered Capstone Project)

- Keywords: data mining, web scraping, network analysis, data visualization, knowledge networks
-	Wrote Python scripts for web-scraping, cleaning data (30,000 rows) from academic citation indexes
-	Built and analyzed knowledge network to identify clusters; Used regression analysis for testing hypotheses
- Visualized the knowledge network using Tableau ([Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rahul1168#!/vizhome/NuclearEnergyResearch/NuclearEnergyResearch))

**Data Science Trainee**, *Clean Energy Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA*

[Time Series Forecast of Renewable Energy in the United States](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Clean-Energy-Outlook) (Coursework Project)

- Keywords: data cleaning, data visualization, time series, machine learning, ridge regression, support vector regression
-	Parsed, cleaned data from government databases; Developed software for model training and evaluation
-	Reduced model error by 50%; Improved unit test coverage by 70%
- Developed visualizations on Tableau ([Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rahul1168#!/vizhome/TableauWorkbookforSVRPrediction/CleanEnergyProductioninthecontiguousUnitedStates))

[Regression Analysis of Harvard Clean Energy Project Database](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/harvard%20clean%20energy%20project%20database) (Coursework Project)

- Keywords: linear regression, logistic regression, multiple linear regression, hypothesis testing, resampling methods
-	Developed regression models and used hypothesis testing to analyze effects of voltage, current on power conversion efficiency
- Performed logistic regression on the Loan Default dataset in Introduction to Statistical Learning book
- Used resampling methods like bootstraping to plot Mean Standard Error (MSE) vs number of bootstrap samples

[K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/k%20nearest%20neighbors%20classifier) (Coursework Project)

- Keywords: k-nearest neighbors, software development, test-driven development
-	Developed own implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier to predict atom type based on its radius
- Wrote unit tests to test the written functions; Tested atomradii data for different k values; Achieved accuracy of upto 80%

[Statistical Analysis of Energy and Water Consumption](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/energy%20and%20water%20consumption) (Coursework Project)

- Keywords: descriptive statistics, box plots, distribution functions, hypothesis testing
- Performed descriptive statistical analysis of the data; Calculated descriptive statistical calculations and plotted box plots
- Plotted normalized histograms and probability distribution functions; Performed hypothesis testing for various hypotheses

### Other Coursework Projects
