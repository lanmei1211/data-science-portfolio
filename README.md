## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

    - [SMDT: A Generalizable Tool for Small-Molecule Property Prediction](https://github.com/BeckResearchLab/small-molecule-design-toolkit):
A Python package to calculate molecular descriptors and test out several different supervised learning algorithms to build the most-appropriate Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model that accurately predicts the chemical properties of small molecules.

    - [E-Commerce Product Classifier](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/e-commerce%20product%20classifier):
An ensemble model for classifying e-commerce products into product categories using product name and product image data from Amazon.
Used a bag-of-words model for text data and a pre-trained VGG-16 model for image data. 

    - [RMS Titanic Passenger Survival](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/titanic):
Exploratory Analysis and a classification model to predict the survival of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic. 

    - [Predicting Housing Prices in Ames, Iowa](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/house%20prices):
A model to predict the value of a given house in Ames, Iowa using various statistical analysis tools. 
Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

    *Tools: scikit-learn, Keras, Pandas*

- ### Natural Language Processing


- ### Time Series

    - [Forecasting of Vehicle Traffic at Signals](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/vehicle%20traffic): 
An additive model where non-linear hourly traffic trends are fit with yearly and weekly seasonality

    *Tools: Pandas, Prophet*

- ### Data Analysis and Visualization

    - [Knowledge Network Analysis of Nuclear Energy Research](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/KnowledgeNetworks): 
Python scripts to download, analyze meta-data from academic citation indexes and a Tableau [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rahul1168#!/vizhome/NuclearEnergyResearch/NuclearEnergyResearch)
of the Knowledge network to track collaborations in nuclear energy research.

    - [Clean Energy Demand in the United States](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Clean-Energy-Outlook): 
An auto-regressive (AR) forecasting model and a Tableau [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rahul1168#!/vizhome/TableauWorkbookforSVRPrediction/CleanEnergyProductioninthecontiguousUnitedStates)
to visualize the future clean energy demand of the United States

    *Tools: Pandas, Tableau, Seaborn, Matplotlib*
