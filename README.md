## Contents

### Machine Learning

- [SMDT: A Generalizable Tool for Small-Molecule Property Prediction](https://github.com/BeckResearchLab/small-molecule-design-toolkit):
A Python package to calculate molecular descriptors and test out several different supervised learning algorithms to build the most-appropriate Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model that accurately predicts the chemical properties of small molecules.

- [E-Commerce Product Classifier](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/e-commerce%20product%20classifier):
A model for classifying e-commerce products into product categories using product data from Amazon. 

- [RMS Titanic Passenger Survival](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/titanic):
Exploratory Analysis and a classification model to predict survival of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic. 

- [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/house%20prices):
A model to predict the value of a given house in Ames, Iowa.

*Tools: scikit-learn, Keras, Pandas*

### Natural Language Processing


### Time Series

- [Forecasting of Vehicle Traffic at Signals](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/vehicle%20traffic): 
An additive model where non-linear hourly traffic trends are fit with yearly and weekly seasonality

*Tools: Pandas, Prophet*

### Data Analysis and Visualization

- [Knowledge Network Analysis of Nuclear Energy Research](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/KnowledgeNetworks): 
A [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rahul1168#!/vizhome/NuclearEnergyResearch/NuclearEnergyResearch)
of the Knowledge network to track collaborations in nuclear energy research.

- [Clean Energy Demand in the United States](https://github.com/rahulavadhoot/Clean-Energy-Outlook): 
A [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rahul1168#!/vizhome/TableauWorkbookforSVRPrediction/CleanEnergyProductioninthecontiguousUnitedStates) of the future clean energy demand of the United States
based on an auto-regressive (AR) forecasting model. 

*Tools: Pandas, Tableau, Seaborn, Matplotlib*
