## Homework 4 is due Thur Feb 23 at 8 am


### Description and purpose 

The purpose of HW4 is to give you practice with the simple regression, multiple regression, classification, and resampling methods. 

### Files contained in this skeleton HW repository 

* README.me: this file 
* HW4-SKEL.ipynb 
* energyuse.csv: student electricity use data, described below 
* GerberdingElectricityChilledWater.csv

### Instructions 

More details are in the Jupyter notebook for HW4. Follow through the notebook and complete all your work there. When you are done, check back in your work. I will check out your completed work and grade it and return to you via check-in when your grade is complete (at the bottom of this notebook).  

Note that I must be able to execute all cells in the notebook starting from top to bottom. I will not "clear all output" from your notebook and then execute it all in order to make sure the notebook works. 

### Grading 

See cues in my skeleton notebook so you can get some information about what I am looking for on each section 

|  Part |  Earned | Possible | Notes  |  
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Short answer  |  5 |  5 |   |   |
| 2. Logistic regression|  15 | 15  |   |   |
| 3. Simple linear regression |  25  | 25  |   | 
|  4. Multiple regression  | 25  | 25   |  |
| 5. Bootstrapping  |  30 | 30   |   |
|  Adjustments  | +5  |    | bonus for excellent work! nice job!  |
| Total grade |105  | |  | 


### A note about comments

Like Dave explained - comments in python (using # in a code cell - or just adding a markdown cell) is critical so I can follow your work. You can't really over-comment things. 

### A Note about collaboration 

My expectation is that everything you type in a Python notebook is your own work.  Any instances of "copy-paste" from the web or another person's notebook should be clearly cited. Of course you may look at examples but it is my strong preference that you refrain from copy-paste and type everything in. There is a learning reason for this, which I am happy to discuss in office hours or on slack.

I will follow UW academic misconduct policy for any suspected instances of cheating on HW or projects. Any confirmed instance of cheating results in a zero on a HW assignment. Any 2nd confirmed instance of cheating results in a zero for the entire course grade.
